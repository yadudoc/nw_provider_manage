The scripts are meant for the Engineering colleges in kerala,primary Polytechnic colleges. There are moves by the govt. to provide multiple connections ( > 5 ) of bandwidth around 500kbps to these colleges. In such scenarios its convenient to configure a central server which routes all the requests rather than individual buildings/departments using separate lines. 

This addresses the problem of load sharing among the different lines as well as handling of cases of individual lines failing.

The approach is to set route tables to properly route the requests. The scripts at present require the user to setup up a config file which contains the details of the individual lines. Please see the config file which is more or less self explanatory. 

TODO :
1. Add code to get information about the lines automatically.
2. Look into the routing issues.
3. Manage caches and possibility of one line taking all traffic.
4. Lots more to do....
